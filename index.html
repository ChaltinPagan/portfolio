                <p>My name is Chaltin Pagan. I am a Full Stack Web Development Fellow at C4Q’s Access Code program.</p>

                <p>I came into coding by accident. One day, I asked my supervisor if I could edit the company’s website. I wanted more responsibility and I thought it would be a piece of cake. I soon realized we worked with a very old WYSIWYG platform and the best way to edit the site was to modify its code. Despite the trepidation of learning a new language, I eagerly wanted to know how to read the code and write it.</p>
                
                <p>Before I started coding, I studied art. In my opinion, a coder is no different from an artist. Each has library of pre-established symbols: for the painter, it’s visuals that hold unequivocal definitions or metaphors; for the coder, it’s the built-in programming language. The painter and the coder take these symbols and arrange them into a meaningful composition. The composition’s story does not end when it’s creator has stopped. For the painting, its interpretation varies from person to person over time. For the code, its content evolves as subsequent contributors input changes over time.</p>
                
                <p>Like painting, coding requires attention to detail. A misspelled word or a missing bracket means the code won’t evaluate. Like the painter, the coder has an idea that she is certain she can write on the first attempt. As the coder works, she discovers there is a need for some experimentation: to write functions more succinctly, to try a built-in object. Both the painter and coder practice their art constantly.</p>
                
                <p>I am a graduate of &lt;project_code&gt; (Phase I) at the New York Public Library. I earned an MFA in Painting from the University of the Arts in Philadelphia and a BA in Art from the City College of New York.</p>
